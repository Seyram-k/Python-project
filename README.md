# Python-project
This repository contains solutions to 4 practical Python programming challenges created by a GI-KACE student. Each problem is rooted in the everyday Ghanaian contexts. The solutions use only fundamental Python concepts taught at the introductory level which makes these programs ideal for classroom practice and self-study.
